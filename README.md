# wultra = Ultra + Wouter

This demo project shows how [wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) can be used with
[Ultra.js](https://ultrajs.dev/), a Deno framework. The upcoming 2.11.0 release of wouter has a
built-in support for server-side rendering via a simple prop `ssrPath` for defining server-side
location.

Other wouter features used here:

- Active links
- Catch-all (404) route
- Nested routing: locale segment e.g. `/es/users`
